# Code of Conduct

We aim for a welcoming, collaborative project. By participating you agree to:

- Be respectful and assume good intent. Harassment, personal attacks, and exclusionary language are not tolerated.
- Give constructive feedback focused on code and behavior, not people.
- Use public channels for project discussions when possible; keep private disclosures for security issues.
- Accept feedback gracefully and work toward consensus. If disagreement persists, maintainers have final say on scope and direction.

If you witness or experience misconduct, please reach out to the maintainers (see GitHub profiles) so we can address it promptly.
